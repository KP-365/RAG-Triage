ere are solid fallback prompts you can use in your chat triage so if the user’s answer is vague, off-topic, or doesn’t contain what you need, the assistant asks a second question that forces the missing detail.

Use these as templates. They work well with your state machine (you can drop them into make_reply() when extraction fails).

1) Universal “I didn’t get it” prompts (polite + direct)

“I didn’t catch that clearly. Could you answer with just yes or no?”

“Just to make sure I get this right, can you give me a short answer (one sentence)?”

2) Age (if they don’t give a number)

Needed: a number
Fallbacks:

“Could you type your age as a number only? Example: 27”

“I need your age to continue. What number should I put down?”

If they type something like “in my twenties”:

“Thanks. Could you give the exact age number (for example 24, 25, 26)?”

3) Main problem / complaint (if they say “I feel unwell”)

Needed: a category
Fallbacks:

“What’s bothering you the most right now: chest pain, breathing, stomach, headache, fever, injury, or something else?”

“If you had to pick one main problem, what would it be?”

If they list many symptoms:

“Out of those, which one is the worst right now?”

4) Onset / timing (if they say “for a while”)

Needed: when it started
Fallbacks:

“When did it start: minutes ago, hours ago, today, yesterday, or more than 2 days ago?”

“Can you estimate roughly: how many hours or days?”

If they say “not sure”:

“No problem. What’s the closest option: today, yesterday, within the last week, or longer?”

5) Severity 0–10 (if they answer with words)

Needed: number
Fallbacks:

“If 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst you can imagine, what number is it?”

“Could you give a number from 0 to 10?”

If they say “really bad”:

“Would you say it’s closer to 3, 6, or 9?”

6) Location (if they say “it hurts”)

Needed: where
Fallbacks:

“Where exactly is it: left side, middle, right side, or hard to pinpoint?”

“Can you point it out in words: chest, upper stomach, lower stomach, head, back?”

7) Yes/No red-flag questions (if they respond with a story)

Needed: yes/no
Fallbacks:

“Thanks — just to confirm, is that a yes or a no?”

“I only need yes or no for safety. Which is it?”

If still unclear:

“I’m going to ask it another way: did it happen at any point today? yes/no”

8) Breathing (if they say “a bit”)

Needed: severity indicator
Fallbacks:

“Are you short of breath at rest (sitting still)? yes/no”

“Can you speak a full sentence without stopping for breath? yes/no”

9) Chest pain specifics (if they dodge or describe generally)

Needed: classic risk features
Fallbacks:

“Is the chest pain new today? yes/no”

“Does it spread to your arm, jaw, or back? yes/no”

“Are you sweaty, clammy, or nauseous with it? yes/no”

10) Neurology / headache (if they say “bad headache”)

Needed: sudden onset + neuro signs
Fallbacks:

“Did it come on suddenly (seconds/minutes)? yes/no”

“Is it the worst headache you’ve ever had? yes/no”

“Any weakness, slurred speech, or confusion? yes/no”

11) Fever/infection (if they give vague symptoms)

Needed: duration and danger signs
Fallbacks:

“Have you had a high temperature for more than 3 days? yes/no”

“Are you confused, very drowsy, or struggling to breathe? yes/no”

12) Confirmation step (if they don’t confirm)

Needed: confirm or correct
Fallbacks:

“Reply confirm if that’s correct, or tell me what I should change.”

“What’s wrong in that summary: age, main problem, when it started, or severity?”

Drop-in “second question” patterns (best ones)
Pattern A: force the format

“Could you answer as yes/no?”

“Could you answer with a number only?”

Pattern B: offer fixed options

“Which one is closest: A, B, or C?”

Pattern C: narrow down

“If you had to pick one symptom as the main issue, what is it?”

If you want it even cleaner (recommended)

Use a single fallback function in your backend like:

If extraction fails → ask a forced format question

If still fails → offer 3 options

If still fails → “I can’t continue safely, please speak to a clinician”
